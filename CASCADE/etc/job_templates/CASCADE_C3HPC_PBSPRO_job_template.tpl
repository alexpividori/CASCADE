#           JOB ARRAY DIRECTIVES  
#               A job array is a compact representation of two or more jobs. 
#               A job that is part of a job array is called a subjob 
#               All subjobs in a job array share a single job script, including the PBS 
#               directives and the shell script portion.
#               Each subjob has a unique index. You can refer to job arrays or parts 
#               of job arrays using the following syntax forms:
#                    job array object itself: sequence_number[] or sequence_number[].server.domain.com
#                              Example: 1234[].server or 1234[]
#                    single subjob with index M: sequence_number[M] or sequence_number[M].server.domain.com
#                              Example: 1234[M].server or 1234[M]
#                    a range of subjobs of a job array: sequence_number[start-end[:step]] or 
#                                                       sequence_number[start-end[:step]].server.domain.com
#                              Example: 1234[X-Y:Z].server or 1234[X-Y:Z]
#
#               Important environmental variables for job array are:
#
#               Environment Variable    Used For           Description
#               PBS_ARRAY_INDEX         subjobs            Subjob index in job array, e.g. 7
#               PBS_ARRAY_ID            subjobs            Identifier for a job array. Sequence number
#                                                               of job array, e.g. 1234[].server
#               PBS_JOBID               Jobs, subjobs      Identifier for a job or a subjob. For subjob,
#                                                               sequence number and subjob index in brackets,
#                                                               e.g. 1234[7].server
#
#
#              Syntax for submitting a job array:
#              #PBS -J <index start>-<index end>[:stepping factor]
#                       index start     is the lowest index number in the range (should be >=0)
#                       index end       is the highest index number in the range
#                       stepping factor is the optional difference between index numbers
#                       Example: #PBS -J 1-1000 or #PBS -J 0-100:2
#
#              Relevant informatiomn on exit status
#
#              Exit    Meaning
#              Status
#              0       All subjobs of the job array returned an exit status of 0. 
#                      No PBS error occurred. Deleted subjobs are not considered
#              1       At least 1 subjob returned a non-zero exit status. No PBS error occurred.
#              2       A PBS error occurred

# --     Define the path for the standard output, error and input of the batch job.   --- 
#                By default, PBS copies stdout and stderr to the job's submission directory.
#                Environment variables CANNOT be used to generare the file names     
#                The default filename  has the following format:
#                             <job_name>.o<sequence_number> for standard output
#                             <job_name>.e<sequence_number> for standard error 
#                Otherwise you can give your specific name to the files.
#                You can specify relative or absolute paths. If you specify only a file name, 
#                it is assumed to be relative to your home directory. DO NOT USE variables in the path.
#                 
#                It is possible to join the stdout and the stderr in one file. This is done 
#                using the option -j as follow:
#
#                -j  join_list
#
#              join_list defines which streams of  the batch job are to be merged.                 
#
#               e     The standard error of the batch job (JOIN_STD_ERROR).
#               o     The standard output of the batch job (JOIN_STD_OUTPUT).
#               n     NO_JOIN
#
#               If 'n' is specified, then no files are joined. The qsub utility shall consider it an  error  if  any
#               join type other than 'n' is combined with join type 'n' .
#               You can specify one of the following joining options:
#                   oe Standard output and standard error are merged, intermixed, into a single stream, which becomes standard output.
#                   eo Standard output and standard error are merged, intermixed, into a single stream, which becomes standard error.
#                    n Standard output and standard error are not merged.
#                 
#                 
##PBS -j %%WHAT_SHOULD_I_DO_WITH_STDOUT_AND_ERR%%
#                 
#        By default, PBS copies stderr to the job submission directory.
#        The default filename  has the following format:
#          <job_name>.o<sequence_number> for standard output
#          <job_name>.e<sequence_number> for standard error 
#        Standard error file name       
#        example:     
#        #PBS -o /lustre/arpa/username/log/
#        #PBS -o /lustre/arpa/username/log/standard_error.txt
#        #PBS -o ../log/standard_error.txt
#            
#            
##PBS -e %%WHERE_TO_SEND_STDERR%%                  
#            
#            
#        By default, PBS copies stdout to the job submission directory.
#        The default filename  has the following format:
#          <job_name>.e<sequence_number> for standard output
#        Standard output file name       
#        example:     
#        #PBS -e /lustre/arpa/username/log/

# --     Defines the resources required for the job        ---
#
#          Your job can request resources that apply to the entire job, or resources that apply to job chunks.
#          If one job process needs two CPUs and another needs 8 CPUs, your job can request two chunks, one 
#          with two CPUs and one with eight CPUs. 
#
#          All of a chunk is taken from a single host.
#
#          Your job cannot request the same resource in a job-wide request and a chunk-level request.
#          A resource is either job-wide or chunk-level, but not both. 
#
#          Job-wide resources are requested in <resource neme>=<value> pairs. 
#          You can request job-wide resources using any of the following formats:
#                 #PBS  -l <resource>=<value>,<resource>=<value>
#                 #PBS -l <resource>=<value> -l <resource>=<value>
#                 One or more #PBS -l <resource name>=<value> directives
#
#          Remember that in reserving cpus it is importnat to remind the meaning of the keywords:
#
#          nodes      = refers to the physical computational nodes and it is deprecated, but it works;
#          ppn        = refers to the processes (or parallel tasks) per node;
#          select     = refers to the physical computational nodes;
#          ncpus      = refers to the physical cpus per node;
#          mpiprocs   = refers to the cpus per node allocated for the mpi;
#          ompthreads = refers to the number of threads in OpenMP.
#
#          This is very important when mpirun is used with $PBS_NODEFILE, because the content of the file
#          $PBS_NODEFILE should match the number N in mpirun -p N when mpirun is invoked 
#
#          The old format  
#                       #PBS -l nodes=3:ppn=32 
#          still works and generated the 3x32 lines in the $PBS_NODEFILE requird as N in the mpirun -p N
#
#          The new format is described here below keeping in mind the following definitions:
#
#              select=# -- allocate # separate nodes
#              ncpus=# -- on each node allocate # cpus (cores)
#              mpiprocs=# -- on each node allocate # cpus (of the ncpus allocated) to MPI
#              ompthreads==# -- on each node run # of threads in  OpenMP (it sets OMP_NUM_THREADS=#) 
#
#          Example on how the system allocates processor cores for MPI jobs.
#
#          #PBS -l select=8:ncpus=8:mpiprocs=8
#
#          The above example allocates 64 cores all of which are for use by MPI (8 nodes with 8 cpus on each node).
#         
#
#          Example on how the system allocates processor cores for OpenMP jobs.
#
#          PBS Professional supports OpenMP applications by setting the OMP_NUM_THREADS variable in the job's 
#          environment, based on the resource request of the job. The OpenMP run-time picks up the value of 
#          OMP_NUM_THREADS and creates threads appropriately.
#
#          #PBS -l select=2:ncpus=10:ompthreads=10
#
#          The above example allocates 20 cores all of which are for use by OpenMP 20 threads 
#          (2 nodes with 10 cpus on each node executing 10 threads each).
#         
#
#          Example on how the system allocates processor cores for mixed MPI + OpenMP jobs.
#
#          #PBS -l select=2:ncpus=16:mpiprocs=8:ompthreads=2 
#
#          The above example allocates 32 cores over 2 nodes (16 on each node) to be used as  
#          8 MPI processes on each node and each MPI has 2 OpenMPI threads 
#          This would automatically set the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 and it can easily be seen 
#          when using OpenMP with MPI that ompthreads multiplied by mpiprocs should equal ncpus if you want 
#          all MPI tasks to each have the same number of threads.
#
#
#
#          Chunk resources are requested in chunk specifications in a select statement. 
#          You can request chunk resources using any of the following:
#                 #PBS -l select=[N:][chunk specification][+[N:]chunk specification] directive
#                 If you do not specify N, the number of chunks, it is taken to be 1.
#                 For example, one chunk might have 2 CPUs and 4GB of memory:
#                 #PBS -l select=ncpus=2:mem=4gb
#                 For example, to request six of the previous chunk:
#                 #PBS -l select=6:ncpus=2:mem=4gb
#                 To request different chunks, concatenate the chunks using the plus sign (+)
#                 For example, to request two sets of chunks where one set of 6 chunks has 2 CPUs per chunk, 
#                 and one set of 3 chunks has 8 CPUs per chunk, and both sets have 4GB of memory per chunk:
#                 #PBS -l select=6:ncpus=2:mem=4gb+3:ncpus=8:mem=4GB
#
#                 No spaces are allowed between chunks.
#                 You must specify all your chunks in a single select statement.
#
#           HERE BELOW THE RESOURCES AT chunck-level
#
##PBS -l select=%%NUMNODES%%:ncpus=%%NUMCORES%%:mpiprocs=%%NUMMPIPROC%%:ompthreads=%%NUMTHREADS%%:mem=%%MAXRAM%%
#
#
#
#           HERE BELOW THE RESOURCES AT job-wide level 
#
#           Specify the maximum  run-time for the job, where walltime=HH:MM:SS
#           example:
#           #PBS -l walltime=2:00:00 (two hours at most)
#
##PBS -l walltime=%%HOW_MUCH_TIME_MAY_I_RUN%%
#
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# --     Defines whether qsub shuld wait until the job ends       ---
#
#    The block job attribute controls blocking. 
#
#    Normally, when you submit a job, the qsub command exits after returning the ID of the new job. 
#    You can use the "-W block=true" option to qsub to specify that you want qsub to "block", 
#    meaning wait for the job to complete and report the exit value of the job.
#
#    If your job is successfully submitted, qsub blocks until the job terminates or an error occurs. 
#    If job submission fails, no special processing takes place.
#    If the job runs to completion, qsub exits with the exit status of the job. 
#    For job arrays, blocking qsub waits until the entire job array is complete, then returns 
#    the exit status of the job array.
#
#     #PBS -W block=true    ----> wait until the job ends
#     #PBS -W block=fasle   ----> return immediately after returning the ID of the new job
#
#PBS -W block=false
#
#
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# --  Defines whether the job should depend on other jobs ends    ---
#     Job dependencies are not supported for subjobs or ranges of subjobs.
#     In case ofdependence on array job use full array identification Job_ID (e.g. 2354[]) 
#
#     Use the -W depend=dependency_lis option to qsub to define dependencies between jobs. 
#     The dependency_list has the format:
#                 type:arg_list[,type:arg_list ...]
#     where except for the on type, the arg_list is one or more PBS job IDs in the form:
#                 jobid[:jobid ...]
#     These are the available dependency types:
#
#        after:arg_list
#        This job may start only after all jobs in arg_list have started execution.
#
#        afterok:arg_list
#        This job may start only after all jobs in arg_list have terminated with no errors.
#
#        afternotok:arg_list
#        This job may start only after all jobs in arg_list have terminated with errors.
#
#        afterany:arg_list
#        This job may start after all jobs in arg_list have finished execution, with or without errors. 
#        This job will not run if a job in the arg_list was deleted without ever having been run.
#
#        before:arg_list
#        Jobs in arg_list may start only after specified jobs have begun execution. 
#        You must submit jobs that will run before other jobs with a type of on.
#
#        beforeok:arg_list
#        Jobs in arg_list may start only after this job terminates without errors.
#
#        beforenotok:arg_list
#        If this job terminates execution with errors, the jobs in arg_list may begin.
#
#        beforeany:arg_list
#        Jobs in arg_list may start only after specified jobs terminate execution, with or without errors. 
#        Requires use of on dependency for jobs that will run before other jobs.
#
#        on:count
#        This job may start only after count dependencies on other jobs have been satisfied. 
#        This type is used in conjunction with one of the before types. count is an integer greater than 0.

       EXPORTED VARIABLES IN THE JOB 

       Environment variables beginning with "PBS_O_" are created by qsub.  
       PBS automatically exports the following environment variables to  the
       job, and the job's Variable_List attribute is set to this list:

       PBS_ENVIRONMENT=$PBS_ENVIRONMENT
            Set to PBS_BATCH for a batch job.  Set to PBS_INTERACTIVE for an interactive job.  
            Created upon execution.

#         Some suggestion on the exit status. It would be helpful to manage 
#         the exist status to have only two possible values. They are:
#
#            0 = job executed correctly
#            1 = impossible to do the job as expected

#
#         DEFINE DEBUG OPTIONS AND ERROR TRAPPING
#
#
      # The trap command allows you to execute a command when a signal is received by your script.
      #
      # The trap command catches the listed SIGNALS, which may be signal names with 
      # or without the SIG prefix, or signal numbers. 
      # If a signal is 0 or EXIT, the COMMANDS are executed when the shell exits. 
      # If the signal is specified as ERR; in that case COMMANDS are executed each 
      # time a simple command exits with a non-zero status. 
      # Note that these commands will not be executed when the non-zero exit status comes 
      # from part of an if statement, or a while or until loop. Neither will they be executed 
      # if a logical AND (&&) or OR (||) result in a non-zero exit code, or when a command 
      # return status is inverted using the ! operator.

      #
      # This is the defaul trap to stop when any command exits without zero.
      # Please read the above lines for more details on if loops and so on limits
      #
      ERROR() { echo -e "\n\tERROR! Job stopped with any error\n\n"; exit 1;}
      trap 'echo -e "\n\n\tKilled by signal"; ERROR;' ERR 

      #
      # Other possible trapps you may want are 
      #
      #  trap 'echo -e "\n\n\tKilled by signal"; ERROR;' 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 13 15 # for a set of signals only.
      #  trap ERROR 0                     # call the function ERROR on exit od the shell. Usefull to clean up on exit.
      #
      # The whole list of sigspec can be accessed by kill -l or man kill or trap -l
      #

      set -e                   # stop the shell on first error
