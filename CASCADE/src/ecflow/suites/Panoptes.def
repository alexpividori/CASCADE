  #
  # For this suite the repeat date is used instead of cron. 
  # The loading and beginning suite date starts and a very far end date
  # has been set, meaning that there is no end. The advantage of using repeat date
  # instead of repeat day 1, to loop the suite every day, is that the variable 
  # reporting the value of the date can be used in the nodes as trigger or to control the flow. 
  # Furthermore you can also manually change the variable value (to reflect current day or any day) 
  # by means of the GUI ecflowviewer. If you do not need this you can stick with repeat day 1
