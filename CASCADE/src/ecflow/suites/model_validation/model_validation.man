               MODEL VALIDATION (suite)
========================================================

This is the manual of the entire model validation suite.
This suite is used to validate model simulation data with 
the counter part in-situ measured data. 
Provided by the colleague Massimo Celio from arpaFVG, we avail 
an ascii file that collect in-situ measures of all northern 
adriatic sea from 2014 to 2021. The measured has been performed
on particular points called monitoring stations. The entire
monitoring stations set is available on arpaFVG official site 
following the link: http://www.arpaweb.fvg.it/mamc/gmapsmamc.asp

The suite is able to validate data coming from different 
models types. At this time it could analyze COPERNICUS Marine
Service model (reading netCDF files) data and SHYFEM Model
(reading ASCII files). 

Every single family is create to validate a single model 
simulation. CMEMS_validation family is used to validate 
COPERNICUS model and SHYFEM_validation for SHYFEM simulations.

If you want to validate different simulations in the same 
suite, you have to copy the entire family (with all his tasks)
and paste below inside the suite definition file: model_validation.def

To get informations about how this suite works, please consult
tasks and family manuals.
