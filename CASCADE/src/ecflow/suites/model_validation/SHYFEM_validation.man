           GENERAL MANUAL for CMEMS Validation family
===============================================================

The entire family CMEMS_validation is used to perform a multi-plot
validation analysis on COPERNICUS Marine oceanographic model.

The reference data-set of comparison is constituted by an ASCII
file collecting the entire in-situ monitoring measures. This 
measured has been performed by Massimo Celio's theme from arpa-FVG
in the time period from 2014 to 2021.

To insert the inputs geographical region and time period desired to 
perform the validation is sufficient to edit the 'pre_initialization_file.txt'
To have more information on this operation, please consult the manual
of "genesis_initialization_file.ecf" task. 

Other model validations will be performed with a similar family.
The only difference will be present in the serching netCDF of other 
data formats files part ( present inside the two jobs throw by 
sel_data_TEMP_PSAL.ecf task ). 

Consulta the include/etc/general.ini initialization file to
