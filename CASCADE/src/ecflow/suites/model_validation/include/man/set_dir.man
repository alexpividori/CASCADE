======================================================================
      This is the manual of the bash script: set_dir.ecf
======================================================================

The main aim of this .ecf script is to prepare the temporary directory
"/model_validation_tmp" inside the /scratch section 
used to realize the entire suite operations.

The "model_validation_tmp" directory is screated. If already present 
it is deleted and then recreated. Inside this temporary directory
all useful R, NCL, bash script or jobs are copied from 
/lustre/arpa/CASCADE/src/model_validation/scripts to model_validation_tmp.

A set of drops_files_# and selected_depths_# directories are created to
put the output ASCII files collecting the selected measured and 
model data. The # indicate the natural number corresponding to the 
'pre_initialization_file.txt' line that is related to. For example
the first pre_initialization_file.txt line data will be contained inside
drops_files_1 and selected_depths_1.

A multi-check is performed. One for creation dir, one for eventual remotion
and one for copying scripts inside that. If only one operation will fail, 
an ERROR message is reported and the task will be aborted.

Another functionality of this task is to create (if doesn't exists) the 
tree of directories used to archive the single simulation validation 
plots inside '/lustre/arpa/CASCADE/public_html/SHYFEM_1995F100D0_ABXX_validation'.
To share the results on a public web-pahe, is also created an html
page accessible on the CASCADE project web-site.
