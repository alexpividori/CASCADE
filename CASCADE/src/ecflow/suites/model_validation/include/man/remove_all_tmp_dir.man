======================================================================
      This is the manual of the bash script: remove_all_tmp_dir.ecf
======================================================================

The only aim of this task is to remove the mother temporary directory  
'model_validation_tmp' ( crated in scratch ) that contains n subdirectories
each one for every single (SHYFEM or not) simulation serial code.

If the remotin can't be ultimated, an error message will be reported.
This is the only check implemented inside this task.
