======================================================================
      This is the manual of the bash script: combined_plots.ecf
======================================================================

This task is used to launch a particular graphs that need the entire 
different simulations datasets.

For this reason it must be launched when SHYFEM_simulation family is 
finished for all different simulations needed.
For now the task is used only for SHYFEM simulations comparison. Every
of these simulations are identified by an alphanumeric serial code of type:
XXXXXXXXXX_XXXX (when X is an upper alpha-numeric digit).
So the operative modality of this task is to create a repeated family 
that cycles on N different simulation SIMULATION_CODE_ECF strings 
(remember to not remove the directories created). 
After the cycle is finished, the family is completed and a new family with
this 'combined_plots.ecf' task can be launched.
The family in which this task is included must have a SIMULATION_CODE_ECF
value because the initialization file used is always the same: general_shy.ini
It is not important what this string value is equal to (you can put a dummy value).
After this task is termined, is a good choise to launch the task that remove 
the entire simulations dataset (for this us 'remove_all_tmp_dir.ecf').

****************************************************************************
            A possible suite architecture is the following
****************************************************************************

family SHYFEM_validation   # this family collects the data for the combined plots
  repeat string  SIMULATION_CODE_ECF 1995F100D0_AB01  1995F100D0_AB02  
                           # this family cycle on the entire set of simulations serial codes

  task set_dir
  task genesis_initialization_file
    trigger set_dir eq complete
  task sel_lines
    trigger genesis_initialization_file eq complete
  task sel_data_TEMP_PSAL
    trigger sel_lines eq complete
  task paste_append_drops
    trigger sel_data_TEMP_PSAL eq complete
  task depth_discrimination
    trigger paste_append_drops eq complete

endfamily 

# after the data extraction is completed for every simulation, you can launch the family 
# that create the combined plots

family combined_analysis
    trigger SHYFEM_validation eq complete
    edit  SIMULATION_CODE_ECF 1995F100D0_AB01   # dummy value: you can use any string you want

  task combined_plots
    repeat string PLOT_TYPE taylor_multi-diagram_R mean_multi-diagram_R median_multi-diagram_R 
                                                # REMEMBER: taylor diagrams need a different depth range vector 

  task remove_all_tmp_dir                       # this is a little bit different from remove_tmp_dir
    trigger combined_plots eq complete

endfamily 

*******************************************************************************

The depth ranges vector used for all simulation analysis must be the same.

The using modality of this task is very similar to master_graph.ecf
An ecflow string variable called PLOT_TYPE has been repeated on a cycle that 
changes his value. The meaning of his key words is the following:

taylor_multi-diagram_R    :  This PLOT_TYPE keyword tell the task to create 
                          a taylor diagram that compare many different shyfem 
                          ran. Each simulation is indicated with a different
                          dot color and the legend indicate the biunivocal
                          correspondence between serial code simulation and color 
                          used

mean_multi-diagram_R      :  This PLOT_TYPE keyword tell the task to create
                          a cartesian plot indicating the mean value of the
                          difference between model physical dimension (Temperature
                          or Salinity) and the in-situ corresponding measure.
                          Every dot is related to a particular depth range.
                          Each simulation is indicated with a different
                          dot color and an external legend indicate the biunivocal
                          correspondence between serial code simulation and color
                          used

median_multi-diagram_R    :  This PLOT_TYPE keyword tell the task to create
                          a cartesian plot indicating the median value of the
                          difference between model physical dimension (Temperature
                          or Salinity) and the in-situ corresponding measure.
                          Every dot is related to a particular depth range.
                          Each simulation is indicated with a different
                          dot color and an external legend indicate the biunivocal
                          correspondence between serial code simulation and color
                          used


IMPORTANT: Use the remove_all_tmp_dir.ecf task (with a trigger) only when the 
           combined_plots.ecf is correctly completed.
