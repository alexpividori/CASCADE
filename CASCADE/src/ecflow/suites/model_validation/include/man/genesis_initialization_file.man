This is the manual of the bash script: genesis_initialization_file.ecf
======================================================================

The aim of this script is to read the pre_initialization_file.txt lines
and create an initialization_file_1.txt, initialization_file_2.txt ...
for every single line present in pre_initialization_file.txt. The difference between 
pre_initialization_file.txt and initialization_file_#.txt is that 
pre_initialization_file.txt is a compress file that contains only two
simple keywords separated by a ";" (semicolon). The first parameter 
indicate the domain of stations you want to analize and the latter the 
time period considered. The first line will produce the initialization_file_1.txt,
the secondo the initialization_file_2.txt, the third initialization_file_3.txt and so on.

genesis_initialization_file.txt is the intermediary between pre_initialization_file.txt
and initialization_file_#.txt. For this reason is important to know how 
genesis_initialization_file.txt interpretate the key-words present in 
pre_initialization_file.txt. The two key words divide in group and time-periods:

======================================================================
                          GROUP PARAMETER
======================================================================

This is the first argument present in the first column in pre_initialization_file.txt
The key-words used are the following:

tot:      This mean the totality of stations. In this way all the stations are taken 
          in analysis. "genesis_initialization_file.ecf" will report the key-word "tot"
          inside the first argument of "initialization_file_#.txt" and then the "sel_lines.ecf"
          reading "tot" for the group parameter won't consider the station_name as a 
          discriminant for selection. It will consider only the time interval.

group1:   According to the stations grouping of Massimo Celio, the group1 is a typology
          of Northern Adriatic sea selection. This group collect the stations 
          near the Marano-Grado lagoon ( belonging to the COPERNICUS-Marine domain ) 
          and that could be influenced by th in and out lagoon currents. The station names
          of "group1" are present in "stations_file_group1.txt" inside the 
          "/lustre/arpa/CASCADE/src/model_validation/scripts" directory.
          ATTENTION: could be presents some stations that apparently doesn't exists (that
          doesn't have a counter part in the catalogue of "http://www.arpaweb.fvg.it/mamc/gmapsmamc.asp").
          Two examples are M111 and SNLG3. The reason is that inside in-situ measures
          data file "arpa-fvg_cruises_2014-2021.txt" are present some human mistakes. In 
          particular some station are writed in a wrong way: for example somewhere is 
          indicated "M111" instead of "ME111". To take count of that mistakes in some 
          "stations_file_group#.txt" files is included also the station in the wrong version.

group2:   According to the stations grouping of Massimo Celio, the group2 is a typology
          of Northern Adriatic sea selection. This group collect the stations
          near the Timavo and Isonzo mouth and other minor rivers and canals. The station names
          of "group2" are present in "stations_file_group2.txt" inside the
          "/lustre/arpa/CASCADE/src/model_validation/scripts" directory.

group3:   According to the stations grouping of Massimo Celio, the group3 is a typology
          of Northern Adriatic sea selection. This group collect the stations
          near the Slovenian and Croatian coasts. These station are the most deep and far from the coast.
          The station names of "group3" are present in "stations_file_group3.txt" inside the
          "/lustre/arpa/CASCADE/src/model_validation/scripts" directory.

station_name: For a more specific analysis, it is also possible to insert the esplicit station_name
              like ME111, P555, SMNG1 ecc. That field parameter will be reported identical in the
              initialization file.

IMPORTANT:
If you want to analize together a set of stations that doesn't correspond to group1, group2 or group3, is
preferible to create a new "stations_file_group#.txt" inside "/lustre/arpa/CASCADE/src/model_validation/scripts"
that collect together the desired stations set. After that you have to insert that option inside
"genesis_initialization_file.ecf". This script version doesn't support other kind of solutions.

Other station groups could be added simply by creating a new "stations_file_group#.txt" file
anf modifying the the "genesis_initialization_file.ecf" script

                          TIME INTERVAL PARAMETER
======================================================================

tot:      This mean the total time period that will be analysed. The in-situ measures
          data file "arpa-fvg_cruises_2014-2021.txt" goes from 2014 to July 2021. However
          the netCDF COPERNICUS-Marine files downloaded always doesn't correspond with  
          time period of in-situ measures ASCII data file. The actual "genesis_initialization_file.ecf"
          version is reported to 2020-07/2021-07 time period cause tha CMEMS files available
          are that. 

season1:  According to the seasons splitting of Massimo Celio, the season1 correspond to 
          the first quarter of the year (January-Febrary-March).

season2:  According to the seasons splitting of Massimo Celio, the season1 correspond to
          the second quarter of the year (April-May-June).

season3:  According to the seasons splitting of Massimo Celio, the season1 correspond to
          the third quarter of the year (July-August-September).

season4:  According to the seasons splitting of Massimo Celio, the season1 correspond to
          the fourth quarter of the year (October-November-December).

1S     :  First semester of the year (from January to June)

2S     :  Second semester of the year (from July to December)

IMPORTANT: For generic time intervals (season1,2,3,4, 1S, 2S and tot) it is implied that all available years will
be considered. For example season1 will select the months Jenuary-Febrary-March indipendently by the years (for Celio's
ASCII file, years goes from 2014 to 2021). If you want to select season1 only for a particular year,
please use the following explicit initialization form. 

YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss_YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss       :  If you want to indicate esplicitly the time period, the 
                                                 format is in this format. The first date YYYY:MM:DDThh:mm:ss
                                                  is the initial 
                                                 time and the second the final. Remember to use an underscore
                                                 "_" to separete the two date. The "T" letter instead separate 
                                                 the date from the hours. For  example the time period
                                                 2021-01-01T00:00:00_2021-03-23T22:32:12 
                                                  goes from the 1-st January of 2021 ( at midnight )
                                                 to the 3-rd of March ( at 22:32:12  ) 
                                                 2021. The extreme intervals are ALWAYS included. Indeed the 
                                                 "sel_lines.ecf" script make a "<=" t2 and ">=" t1
