======================================================================
      This is the manual of the bash script: master_graph.ecf
======================================================================

"master_graph.ecf" is a script ecflow task used to manage the desired
plots. It's functioning is similar to master_plot.ecf of the analysis
suite. 
Inside model_validation.def there is a loop on %PLOT_TYPE% variable ( realized
with the "repeat" command). The PLOT_TYPE is a string variable indicating the 
plot type you want to realize. It's value consists in a short
significative key-word that summarizes the plot content and the 
software used to realize it. 
"master_graph.ecf" script consists on a big for-loop on pre_initialization_file.txt
lines. At each cycle, a block code is launched according to the PLOT_TYPE
value. Inside this block one or more plotters are launched passing them some
important parameters (place, period, input_dir, output_dir).
For this reason every PLOT_TYPE is realized for every single
'pre_initialization_file.txt' line.

====================== PLOT_TYPE format ===================

It's format is:      key-word1_(key-word2)_software-name

Where key-word1 is a shortcut to indicate the plot content is a 
easy and quick way. kay-word2 is an optionally second shortcut
to give more information upon plot content. Maybe other key-words
could be present. 
Software-name is insted leterally the name of the software used 
to realize the plot. In out case is could be: NCL, GMT or R

====================== PLOT_TYPE available ====================

TS_diagram_NCL:       This PLOT_TYPE expressione is used to realize a
                      TS diagram with NCL for every single drop in
                      the time period and for monitoring stations
                      indicated in "pre_initialization_file.txt".
                      In the TS diagrams measured value are marked by 
                      a trinagle and model values by a circle.

boxplot_R:            This PLOT_TYPE expressione is used to realize a
                      boxplot diagram for temperature and salinity
                      by R software. A single box is represented for
                      every depth interval present inside the
                      initialization file "general.ini". The boxplot 
                      used is the standard boxplot for R indicating
                      mean value, 1-st and 3-rd quartile by the bottom
                      and upper sides of the box and whiskers with 1.5
                      interquartile (IQR) maximum length. 
                     
taylor_R:             This PLOT_TYPE expressione is used to realize a
                      taylor diagram for temperature and salinity
                      by R software. A single taylor diagram is realized
                      for every depth interval present inside the
                      initialization file "general.ini". If you want to
                      take into account only a single depth-level, you
                      have to manipulate "depth_ranges_array" inside
                      "general.ini" according to extract only one depth
                      level during "depth_discrimination.ecf" task.

sctr_abs_R:           Shortcut for 'scatter absolute values'. 
                      This PLOT_TYPE expressione is used to realize a
                      scatter pot for only measured temperature and salinity
                      by R software. The depth variable is represented along
                      y axis with a reversed direction: increasing from the
                      top to the bottom. Every measured valued is indicated 
                      with a red circle on the Carthesian plane.
