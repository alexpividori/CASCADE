======================================================================
      This is the manual of the bash script: paste_append_drops.ecf
======================================================================

Tipical run-time: 0-10 seconds

The main aim of this .ecf script is to create two important ASCII data 
files. 
The first one is a file that contains the entire set of temperature 
and salinity drops files (created by 'sel_data_TEMP_PSAL.ecf') names 
in a CSV (;) format. The name of this .txt file is "list_files_TEMP_PSAL.txt"
and is useful for certains plot scripts like TS_celio_comparison.ncl.

The second one type file is a big data ascii document that contains the 
entire drops database appended in a single file. The name of this document
is TEMP_total_data.txt (for temperature) and PSAL_total_data.txt
( for salinity ). This aperation is realized with a >> appender structure.
