      This is the manual of the bash script: sel_lines.ecf
======================================================================

Tipical run-time: 0-1 minute

The main aim of this .ecf script is to realize the first important step
for the selection of analysis data.  

This code read the initialization_file_#.txt (one for each 
pre_initialization_file.txt line) and extract from measured ascii file
( arpa-fvg_cruises_2014-2021.txt  ) the data lines that satisfy
the constraints contained inside 'initialization_file_#.txt'.
In particular it checks the monitoring station name and the time of 
measurement. If these information are included inside intialization file,
the corresponding line is selected and saved into a macro ascii file 
called "list_lines.txt". The CSV format is changed from a tab separator
used inside arpa-fvg_cruises_2014-2021.txt to a ";" separator used
inside "list_lines.txt" file. For simplicity all files created by this 
suite are in CSV format with a semicolon (;) as separator.

To reduce the running time, the 'sel_lines.ecf' script is divided into 
two parts: one used to select all the monitoring stations (that doesn't
consider the station name of arpa-fvg_cruises_2014-2021.txt) and anotherone
used to select a specific monitoring station. This part uses the grep
command to create a temporary file that contains the measuses for only 
one particular station. This secondary will then be passed in a while loop
to check the time variable. After this loop the tmp file is deleted.

IMPORTANT: When the initial and final date inside initialization_file_#.txt
is indicated without the year ( MM-DDThh-mm-ss ), this format means that
all the available years contained in measurements ascii file ( in our case 
arpa-fvg_cruises_2014-2021.txt ) have to be accepted. For this reason the
measurement date string format of arpa-fvg_cruises_2014-2021.txt will be 
modified from YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm-ss to MM-DDThh-mm-ss.
If you know that some model data (netCDF files) are not available for certain
years (so that time period won't be analysed for major causes), don't use
an untied year notation like season1, season2, 1S ecc but use a manual
time selection with the following format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss_YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss
This will increase the speed of selection lines.
