======================================================================
      This is the manual of the bash script: remove_tmp_dir.ecf
======================================================================

The only aim of this task is to remove the temporary directory  
'model_validation_tmp' ( crated in scratch ) to reduce occupied memory 
and to keep ordered and "clean" the working area.

If the remotin can't be ultimated, an error message will be reported.
This is the only check implemented inside this task.
