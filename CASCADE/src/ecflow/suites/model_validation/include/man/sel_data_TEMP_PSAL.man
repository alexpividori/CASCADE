      This is the manual of the bash script: sel_data_TEMP_PSAL.ecf
======================================================================

Tipical run-time: 0-10 minutes

This is the most complex, important and lasting task of the entire 
model_validation suite.
The main aim of this .ecf script is to produce a set of many ascii files
one for every single in-situ measured drop with a new column pasted
indicating the corresponding model data values. 

This task launches two contemporary jobs (one for Temperature and one
for Salinity ) that do the same thing for two different physical dimensions.

The jobs is able to read the list_lines.txt file that contain the entire
selected lines from in-situ measurements ascii file (see sel_lines.man)
and divide it into single drops files (one for each measured drop). The
output data file is always in CSV semicolon format with a less number of 
information (only the important ones are saved).
After the extraction of a single drop data, a new temporary ascii file
with the corresponding model COPERNICUS data is created with a cdo 
multi-command. The same hour, the same lon/lat coordinate and the same
depth levels are interpolated on an hourly netCDF file to extract the 
corresponding model values (for temp and sal). This temporary ascii file
is pasted next to the measured drop file and the resulting complete single 
drop ascii file is saved with the following format name: 
[station_name]_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[hh-mm-ss]_TEMP.txt (for temperature) and
[station_name]_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[hh-mm-ss]_PSAL.txt (for salinity). 

If the monitoring station is placed outside the CMEMS domain, the ouput
of the cdo command will be constituted of only missing values indicated with 
the 1e+20 value. If the first depth value report this missing value, it
means that that lon/lat point is placed outside the model domain and so the
drop file is useless. For this reason it's name is not included inside the
'list_files_TEMP.txt' or 'list_files_PSAL.txt' files list.
